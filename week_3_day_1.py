# # Working With Strings

# # 1. Working With Numbers
# # 2. Getting Input From Users


# # 1. Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2. Mad Libs Game





# # Review
# create variables for the following:
# 1. age
age = 16
# 2. name
name = "Anabel"
# 3. song
song = "Dance Monkey"
# 4. food
food = "gorditas"
# 5. number
number = 944

# #now include the variables you just made print the following ...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] year old coder named [name].
print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " year old coder named " + name + ".")
# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying
# that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
print(name + " liked to hum the song " + song + " while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw " + food + " until " + name +  "would stop singing.")
# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. 
print("Still, " + name + " was the best coder on the team and could write " + str(number) + " lines of code every day.")
# Maybe [song] was [name]'s secret power?
print("Maybe " + song + " was " + name + "'s secret power?")


number1 = 100
number2 = 200
number3 = 300
number4 = 400
number5 = 500
# put all of these into a sentence
# print(str(number) + "," + str(number1) + "," + str(number2) + "," + str(number3) + "," + str(number4) + "," + str(number5) + ".")
#f strings
print(f"{number}.{number1},{number2},{number3},{number4},{number5}.")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'"/?|\()!@#$%^&*~`-+=
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters "l" (lowercase letter el), "O" (uppercase letter oh),
# or "I" (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" or "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:

# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list_of_names
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following instructions:



# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# first_variable
# email_address
# percentage
